# Biography

Annie Wang is a graduate student at the university of Florida. Her research currently focuses on investigating the brain mechanisms underlying motor-evoked pain and its association with motor behavior in patients with chronic pain. Electrophysiological techniques (EMG, EEG) and brain imaging (MRI, fMRI, dMRI) are the primary tools used to unravel the mysteries of perceiving pain and how it affects force production.
